>India's economic problem is structural in nature: ***not enough capacity to produce the advanced things we want today.***


Take our Bollywood and media industries. Lots of "entertainment" jobs, but almost the entire infrastructure (all those TV trucks, the sophisticated electronics in them, including the video/audio recording equipment, satellite uplinking equipment and so on), the whole thing is imported. I am not even mentioning the TV sets at home here, and India does not have the capacity to design the valuable components in them (LCD, LED etc) and yet we buy lots and lots of TVs. 

So the more TV we watch, the more jobs we create in the "entertainment industry", the larger our imports of all this. Guess where most of the electronics for the broadcast industry come from? Japan. What do we have to give in return to Japan? Mostly { }  

In the same way, India is building a lot of hospitals and scan centers and the like. Most of the advanced equipment is imported, and India lacks the capability or know-how for most of them. Even in pharmaceuticals, where India has a fairly large industry, the know-how only extends to generic chemicals and even that is slipping because Indian pharma companies import the base chemicals from China. Most new drugs are biologiques, not synthetic chemicals - biologiques are made by biological processes, hence the term "bio-technology"  - and the know-how for biologiques is mostly non-existent in India. 

***A nation that stays on this course will eventually get enslaved because we want so many advanced products that we do not have the capacity to produce, and ultimately we have to pledge our own souls to be able to afford those things.*** That is just another definition of colonialism. 

Greece is a modern day example - they wanted all the fine products of Germany but only had their own souls (and a little bit of tourism to their great sites of antiquity or their great beaches) to offer in return. Greece was a great nation, the foundation of Western civilization. Today, it is a colony of the EU/Germany, and that is how the Greeks themselves see it. 

The old spiritual masters of India said "Do not want all the material things and be free". But that ship has sailed. My "spiritual economics" lesson is "If you cannot avoid wanting them, at least be able to produce the things you want!"
